## Hello Geek,
   Thanks for choosing the django3.0.5-boilerplate to start your project.
  This boilerplate code comes with Django 3.0.5 & Python 3.8.2. The project structure is slightly modified in this boilerplate to make it comfortable for the developers to build their ideas on top of this.

## Project Structure
    - apps (all the apps goes here)
        - app1
        - app2
    - tests (all the tests goes here)
    - settings (all the settings goes here)
    - manage.py
    - deployment (all the deployment scripts goes here)
    - Dockerfile

## Running Tests
   Django Nose is added to the requirements and is attached to the
boilerplate code. You can write and run your tests using the nose.
 ```python manage.py test``` to run the test. Once the tests are completed a .xml xunit file and the HTML coverage of the test cases will be available in the project root.

## Code Quality
  Since this comes with the pre-commit hook preconfigured the code you push to your repository will be of good. Do ```pre-commit install``` from the project root if the pre-commit hooks are not working properly if you are making any new git commits.

##### CURRENT VERSION: 0.0.1

More updates will be coming in the next updates. We will be updating the code when the version of any of the packages in the requirements changes.


#### STAY TUNED
