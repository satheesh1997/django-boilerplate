        - app1
        - app2
    - tests (all the tests goes here)
    - settings.py
    - manage.py
    - scripts (all the scripts goes here)

    - Jenkinsfile

TESTS:
    Django Nose is added to the requirements and is attached to the
boilerplate code. You can write and run your tests using nose.
